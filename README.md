# GenerateDNNTestUsers
An SQL script to create 999 Test Users for DNN

The script uses "dbo." as the database owner and "dnn_" as object qualifier.

After running the script you have to recycle the application pool.

**NOTE:** Names and email addresses of these users are fictional and any resemblances to persons living or dead are purely coincidental and unintended. If you feel that your name and/or email address is disclosed please go to [https://www.dnnwerk.at/en/Contact]() and leave me a note - I will immediately remove "your" record.
